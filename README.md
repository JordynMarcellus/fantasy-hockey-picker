# Why?

This is my first attempt at building, myself, a full-stack JS application using a relational database. We are using node, express and postgres -- all containerized through docker.

# Setup Guide

You will need a few things:
- Docker engine: https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/
- Docker compose: https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/
- Environment files: Ask Jordyn for now since they have these in the form that works best
- Node & npm: https://nodejs.org/en/ (after this just type `npm install` in the root folder for all the packages you will need)
